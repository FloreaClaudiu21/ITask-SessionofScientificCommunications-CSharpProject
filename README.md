<h2>
  As a part of my software development coursework, I developed a task management system using C# programming language. The system offers a range of features that enable users to manage their tasks smartly. Users can create and delete tasks, group them into different categories, and set priority levels based on their importance.
  One of the standout features of the system is the ability to receive notifications via email and a message box before a task is scheduled to start. Users can receive notifications one minute before the task starts, as well as when the task is marked as "in progress". This feature is particularly useful for individuals who have a lot on their plate and need to stay organized.
  The task management system was developed with a user-friendly interface, making it easy to use and navigate. It was rigorously tested to ensure seamless performance and minimal errors.
Overall, the project was a great learning experience for me, allowing me to develop my skills in software development and enhance my problem-solving abilities.</h2>
