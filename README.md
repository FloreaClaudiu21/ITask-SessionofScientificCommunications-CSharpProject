<h2>
  I developed a music player program using C#. The program is capable of playing MP3 files and allows the user to select a track from a playlist. The music player was designed with a user-friendly interface and intuitive controls, making it easy for anyone to use.
  One of the main features of the music player is its ability to create and manage playlists, allowing users to organize their music collection according to their preferences. The program also includes an option to repeat a track or playlist and a shuffle feature for a more diverse listening experience.
  As a student, I aimed to develop a high-quality application that could rival popular music players in the market. The program was thoroughly tested and optimized to ensure smooth playback and minimal resource usage. Overall, the music player project was a great learning experience, allowing me to sharpen my programming skills and gain valuable experience in software development.</h2>
